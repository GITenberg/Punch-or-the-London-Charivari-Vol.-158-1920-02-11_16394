<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>"If a burglar broke into my house," says Lady <font
  class="sc">Beecham</font>, "I should use the telephone to summon help."
  Lady <font class="sc">Beecham</font> seems to have a sanguine
  temperament.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Asked how she would act in case a burglar broke into her house, Miss
  <font class="sc">Iris Hoey</font> said she would stand before him and
  recite <font class="sc">Shakspeare</font>. If anybody else had said this
  we should have suspected a cruel nature.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A libel action arising, out of the representation by a German artist
  of the ex-<font class="sc">Crown Prince</font> as a baboon is to be heard
  shortly. It is not yet known who is to prosecute on behalf of the local
  Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Nine thousand officials have been appointed to control the food
  supplies in Petrograd. English Government officials regard this
  arrangement as the work of an amateur.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is said that the exchange crisis is regarded by Mr. <font
  class="sc">C.B. Cochran</font> as a deliberate attempt to divert
  attention from the <font class="sc">Dempsey</font> contest.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The rumour that <font class="sc">Carpentier</font> and <font
  class="sc">Dempsey</font>, in order to avoid further fuss and publicity,
  have decided to fight it out privately, appears to have no
  foundation.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Wrexham Education Committee is reconsidering its decision against
  teaching Welsh in the elementary schools. The pathetic case of a local
  man who was recently convicted of stealing a leg of beef owing to his
  being unable to give his evidence in Welsh is thought to have something
  to do with it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A domestic servants' union has been formed and an advertisement for a
  good plain shop stewardess (two in family; policeman kept) will, we
  understand, shortly appear in <i>The Morning Post</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>During the recent gales on the West Coast of Ireland the anemometer
  registered the unprecedented velocity of one hundred-and-ten miles per
  hour. A number of cases of anemonia are reported from the Ph&#339;nix
  Park district.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to <i>Men's Wear</i>, silk hats are to be increased in price
  by at least thirty per cent. Is it by this process, we wonder, that they
  hope to drive Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill</font> out of business?</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A pig and sty constituted first prize at a recent whist drive at
  Bishop's Waltham. We understand that a difference of opinion between the
  winner and the pig as regards the user of the sty has ended fatally for
  the latter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is reported that the Victory badge now being worn extensively in
  New York is to be replaced by another bearing the inscription, "We did
  them."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"I intend to tour England," says a Prohibition lecturer, "and I will
  not be hurried." We recommend the railway.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Tralee man charged with shooting a neighbour said he had no desire
  to break the law. It seems that he mistook the man for a policeman.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A French physician declares that a gift for yawning is one of the most
  valuable health-assets. This should be good news for revue-producers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Honesty," says Dr. <font class="sc">Ingram</font>, "is the best
  policy after all." All the same some of our profiteers seem to get along
  pretty well, thank you.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The egg-laying competition promoted by <i>The Daily Mail</i> has
  proved a great success. It is most gratifying to learn that the hens have
  done their best for "the paper that got us the shells."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The influenza microbe," announces a medical journal, "has made its
  appearance in many parts of the country and is slowly but surely making
  its way towards London." With any other Government than ours a simple
  suggestion that the sign-posts <i>en route</i> should be reversed would
  have been at once adopted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>During the last four weeks exactly four hundred and ninety-nine rats
  have been destroyed in a small town in South Bedfordshire. It is hoped
  that as soon as these figures are published a sporting rodent will give
  itself up in order to complete the fifth century.</p>

<h2>"SMALL ADS."</h2>

  <p>"Where do you get servants from?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"From small ads.," said Phyllis promptly.</p>

  <p>I picked up the paper from the floor where I had thrown it in the
  morning. My wife is one of those rare women who always leave things where
  you put them. It is this trait that endears her to me. I ran my trained
  eye over an ad. column.</p>

  <p>"Got it at once," I said with pardonable pride. "How's
  this?&mdash;'General (genuine), stand any test trd. £70 possess. s. hands
  yrs. s.a.v.'"</p>

  <p>"I like genuine people," said Phyllis thoughtfully. "And under the
  circumstances"&mdash;(here she looked hard at me, as if I were a
  circumstance)&mdash;"under the circumstances I think we ought to have one
  that will stand any test. Seventy pounds is out of the question, of
  course, but she might come for less when she sees how small we are. What
  does 's. hands yrs.' stand for?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I said; "I can only think of 'soft hands for
  years.'"</p>

  <p>"I should like her," said Phyllis. "Their hands are the one thing
  against Generals. She must be a nice girl to take such care of them.
  Think how careful she'd be with the china. What's 'trd.'?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it must mean tired," I said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she'd soon get rested here," said Phyllis; "I don't think that
  need be against her. She's probably been in a hard place lately. Are
  there any more?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty," I said. "How does this one strike you?&mdash;'General. no
  bacon. possess. 2 rms. £45 wky. s.a.v.'"</p>

  <p>"I like that one," said Phyllis. "She must be an awfully unselfish
  girl to go without bacon. I don't see how we are going to spare two
  rooms, though, unless she's willing to count the kitchen as one.
  Forty-five pounds a week must be a printer's error. But we can easily
  afford forty-five pounds a year."</p>

  <p>"It may mean that she's 'weakly,'" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't matter much," said Phyllis; "and I like her the better
  for being honest about it."</p>

  <p>"'Wky.' <i>might</i> stand for 'whisky,'" I hinted darkly.</p>

  <p>Phyllis blanched. "Then she's no good," she said; "I simply couldn't
  stand one that drinks. What's the next one like?"</p>

  <p>I read on: "Domestic oil no risk. 6 dys. trd. s. hands 10 yrs.
  s.a.v."</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether that means that she <i>can</i> cook on an oil-stove
  or that she <i>can't</i> cook on any other kind? And does the 'no risk'
  refer to her or the stove? It's not very clear. I don't think we'll take
  up this one's references. Besides I shouldn't like one that was tired for
  six days."</p>

  <p>"Out of every seven," I added, "and the seventh day would be the
  Sabbath, and her day off."</p>

  <p>"Go on to the next," said Phyllis firmly.</p>

  <p>The next one merely said; "General. Kilburn tkg. £40 1 rm. s.a.v."</p>

  <p>"It would be nice to have a taking sort of girl," I thought
  (unfortunately aloud).</p>

  <p>"We won't think of her, the hussy!" said Phyllis. "Pass me the paper,
  please."</p>

  <p>"They all seem to want 's.a.v.,'" she said. "What do you suppose it
  means? I wish they wouldn't use so many abbreviations. 'S.a.' stands for
  Sunday afternoon, of course, but I can't think what the 'v.' is for. Of
  course we'll give them Sunday afternoons free, if that's what it means. I
  only wonder they don't want an evening off in the week as well. I call
  them most reasonable. And there are so many to choose from. I always
  understood from mother that they're so hard to get."</p>

  <p>Then she turned the paper over.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are stupid!" she said. "You've been looking at the 'Shops and
  Businesses for Sale' column."</p>

  <p>"So've you," I snapped.</p>

  <p>And then I regret to say we had our first quarrel.</p>

  <p>I told Phyllis firmly that she is not at all tkg., nor would she stand
  any test; that no one could engage her, much less marry her, without
  taking risks; that she hadn't had s. hands for yrs., that <i>she</i>
  wouldn't go without her bacon for anyone, and that I should be jolly
  thankful if she would take every blessed s.a.v.</p>

  <p>I admit that Phyllis was more dignified. She merely sailed out of the
  room, remarking that I made her trd.</p>

<h2>RINGS FROM SATURN.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Extracted from various issues of "The
Daily Mandate."</i>)</p>

<p class="center">I.</p>

  <p><i>To the Editor of "The Daily Mandate."</i></p>

  <p><font class="sc">Sir,</font>&mdash;For a number of years I have been
  experimenting in wireless telephony with my installation on the heights
  of Lavender Hill. On several occasions recently I have been puzzled by
  mysterious ringings of the bell attached to the instrument, which have
  obviously been set up by long-distance waves. On taking up the receiver,
  however, I have been unable to make out any coherent message, but only a
  succession of irregular squeaks, although once I distinctly, heard a word
  which I can only transcribe as "Gurroo." I have no doubt in my own mind
  that one of the more advanced planets is trying to get in touch with us
  by means of wireless telephony, and that once we have deciphered the code
  we shall be able to converse freely with its inhabitants. I myself
  incline to the belief that these rings emanate from Saturn, which, in
  spite of its great distance from the earth, is just as likely to wish to
  communicate with us as any other planet.</p>

<p class="center">Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="author"><font class="sc">Diogenes Dottle</font>, F.R.S.</p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dottle's remarkable letter, published in our issue of yesterday,
  suggesting that inhabitants of Saturn have been endeavouring to
  communicate with the earth by means of wireless telephony, has created
  profound excitement in scientific and other circles. To a representative
  of <i>The Daily Mandate</i> a number of well-known men expressed their
  views on the matter, which will undoubtedly stimulate further
  investigation into the momentous possibilities of this epoch-making
  revelation. The opinions advanced, which are, on the whole, highly
  favourable to Mr. Dottle's theory, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Sir Potiphar Shucks, the famous astronomer</i>: "The possibility
  that Saturn is inhabited is one that, in the absence of incontrovertible
  evidence either way, should not lightly be set aside. Assuming that it is
  inhabited, that its people are skilled in the use of wireless telephony
  and that it is possible to set up waves of sufficient intensity to travel
  all the way from Saturn to us, I see no reason why communications of the
  nature suggested by Mr. Dottle should not at some future date become an
  accomplished fact."</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Artesian Pitts, the well-known imaginative historian</i>: "I
  have long held the belief that Saturn is inhabited by a type of being
  possessing a cylinder-like body composed of an unresisting pulp, a high
  dome-shaped head filled with gas, and long tentacles, bristling with
  electricity, through which all sensations are emitted and received. These
  tentacles would act as an ideal telephonic apparatus, so that there is
  every likelihood of Mr. Dottle's having actually received a message from
  Saturn. I take 'Gurroo' to be Saturnian for 'Hello.'"</p>

  <p><i>Signor Tromboni, the pioneer of wireless telephony</i>: "We are
  making <span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg
  105]</span> arrangements to test Mr. Dottle's interesting theory, and for
  this purpose are erecting a special installation on the top of Mt.
  Kilimanjaro, which is several thousand feet higher than Lavender Hill. At
  our own stations we have frequently noticed mysterious ringings, which we
  have hitherto ascribed to carelessness on the part of operators; but Mr.
  Dottle's letter opens up a new world of possibilities. <i>The Daily
  Mandate</i> is to be congratulated on the prominence it has given to the
  subject, which has already had the effect of sending Tromboni shares up
  several points."</p>

  <p><i>Mr. G. Shawburn</i>: "It is an insult to Creation to assume that
  ours is the only populated planet. Of course Saturn is inhabited, but,
  unlike our own world, by people of intelligence. In the matter of mental
  advancement Saturn can make rings round the earth. All the same I don't
  for one moment suppose that Mr. Dottle knows what he's talking
  about."</p>

  <p><i>The <font class="sc">Postmaster-General</font></i>: "Nothing is
  known in the Department under my control of telephone calls having been
  received from Saturn or the neighbourhood. I do not propose for the
  present to take any steps in the matter."</p>

  off."</p>

<p class="center">III.</p>

  <p>(<i>Extract from leading article.</i>)</p>

  <p>"... Again we ask, 'What is the Government doing?' For several days
  now our columns have been ringing with the world-wide acclamation of this
  stupendous discovery, beside the potentialities of which the wildest
  efforts of imaginative literature are reduced to pallid and uninspired
  commonplaces. Even so cautious a scientist as Sir Potiphar Shucks has
  declared that the idea of Saturn being inhabited is one that 'should not
  lightly be set aside,' and has announced his conviction that under
  favourable conditions communication with that planet should in the near
  future become 'an accomplished fact.' Other eminent leaders of thought
  and action, including Signor Tromboni, are even more enthusiastic in
  their reception of the great theory first given to the world by Mr.
  Diogenes Dottle in a letter to <i>The Daily Mandate</i>. But the <font
  class="sc">Postmaster-General</font> is content to treat the question
  with the airy scepticism and obstructive complacency that have rendered
  the London Telephone service a byword of inefficiency, and refuses even
  to make a grant in aid of the work of investigation.</p>

  <p>"In these circumstances the proprietors of <i>The Daily Mandate</i>
  have much pleasure in announcing that they will pay the sum of ten
  thousand pounds to the first man, woman or child in the British Empire
  who can produce evidence of having received an intelligible telephonic
  message from Saturn, and a further sum of one hundred thousand pounds to
  the first person to send a message to that planet and receive a clear
  reply. The services of a Board of distinguished experts are being engaged
  for the purpose of testing and adjudicating all claims.</p>

<h2>A VERMIN OFFENSIVE.</h2>

  <p>There was a faint scuffling sound behind the wainscot.</p>

  <p>"There it is again," said Araminta.</p>

  <p>"Not a doubt of it," I replied, turning pale.</p>

  <p>Thrusting on my hat I rushed up the hill to the Town Hall and asked to
  see the Clerk of the Borough Council immediately.</p>

  <p>"I have reason to suspect," I said in a hoarse low whisper, as soon as
  I was shown into the man's presence, "that our premises are in imminent
  danger of being infested. Counsel me as to what I should do."</p>

  <p>"It is your duty as a good citizen to take such steps as may from time
  to time be necessary and reasonably practicable to destroy the vermin,"
  he said in a rather weary and mechanical tone.</p>

  <p>"I hope I am not one to take my civic duties lightly," I replied with
  some <i>hauteur</i>, "but observe that I merely said I had reason to
  suspect the imminence of the peril. I should like to know the legal
  definition of infestment, if you please. I cannot definitely say that
  house-breaking has taken place as yet. I do not know that there has even
  been petty larceny. There may have been merely loitering with felonious
  intent."</p>

  <p>"What is the size of your premises?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"It is more a messuage than a premises," I explained. "About twelve
  feet by ten, I should say&mdash;speaking without the lease."</p>

  <p>"And how many vermin do you expect it to be about to harbour?"</p>

  <p>"None have actually hove in sight at present," I said reassuringly,
  "but there is a sound of one in the offing&mdash;in the wainscoting, I
  mean."</p>

  <p>"In a residence of your size I should say that a single mouse would
  constitute infestation within the meaning of the Act, so soon as it
  forces an ingress. It will then be your bounden duty to demolish it. How
  about purchasing a trap?"</p>

  <p>"You are sure that is better than hiding behind the arras and hitting
  it over the head with a pole-axe?" I inquired anxiously, "or proffering
  it a bowl of poisoned wine?"</p>

  <p>"Poison is no longer supplied free," he answered coldly, and I went
  out.</p>

  <p>Very luckily, as I hastened up the hill, I had observed a building
  with the words, "Job Masters. Traps for Hire," written upon a wooden
  board. I went inside and found an elderly man sitting at a desk in a
  small office. He looked extremely patient. "Are you Job?" I asked
  breathlessly. "I have come to buy a mouse-trap."</p>

  <p>Appearances, of course, are quite often deceptive. They were in this
  case. The elderly man was very much annoyed. When he had explained
  matters forcibly to me I went on down the hill and entered an
  ironmonger's.</p>

  <p>"I wish to buy a trap to catch a mouse," I said to the assistant
  behind the counter.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Sir. What size?" said the lad politely.</p>

  <p>"Small to medium," I replied, rather baffled. "It has only a
  medium-sized scratch."</p>

  <p>He showed me a peculiar apparatus made of wire and wood containing
  apparently a vestibule, two reception rooms, staircase and first-floor
  lobby, with an open window and a diving-board. Underneath the window was
  a small swimming tank.</p>

  <p>"I don't want a hydropathic exactly," I explained. "I propose to
  exterminate this rodent, not to foster longevity in it. How does it
  work?"</p>

  <p>He pointed out that, after examining the various apartments, the
  animal would be allured by the fragrance of a small portion of cheese
  placed above the diving-board; overbalancing, it would then be projected
  into the water, where it would infallibly drown. "It is a thoroughly
  humane instrument," he assured me, "and used in the best 'omes."</p>

  <p>I bought it and went on to a cheese foundry. Araminta was rather
  scornful of the sanatorium when I came home with it and set it, loaded
  and trained, on the dining-room floor; but the children were delighted.
  It ranked only a little lower than the pantomime, and if only we could
  have secured an outside visitor to it I believe that it would have
  defeated the Zoo. To visit it with a sort of wistful hope became the
  principal treat of the day. But, alas, the mansion remained untenanted.
  Sometimes during a lull in conversation we would hear the faint scuffling
  again, but after about six days I became convinced, by kneeling down and
  placing my ear to the carpet like an Indian, that the noise was even
  fainter than it had been at first. A terrible suspicion seized me. I
  dashed out and rang the bell of the flat next door.</p>

  <p>"It is just as I feared," I said to Araminta on returning a few
  moments later. "We are not going to be infested after all. The vermin has
  been sighted in No. 140<font class="sc">b</font>."</p>

  <p>"We must make the best of it," she said, trying to speak cheerfully,
  "though it <i>is</i> hard on the children, poor dears."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of the children," I replied bitterly; "I was
  thinking of the expense. If we had been living in a house instead of a
  flat we could at least have deducted it from the rates."</p>

  <p>I sat down and made out a bill as follows to the Clerk of the Borough
  Council, heading it:&mdash;</p>

  <pre>
  <i>On Account of Spurious Infestment.</i>
                                        <i>s.  d.</i>
  To one Mouse Institute and Aquarium   5   6
  "  Cheese                             0   6
  "  Labour at 2/6 per hour             0   71/2
                                        ------
  Total                                 6   71/2
  </pre>

  <p>The man replied coldly that the householder was responsible for all
  expenditure incurred in precautionary measures and that the Council was
  in no way liable for the costs resulting from an offensive that failed to
  materialize. He ended with the rather rude postscript, "What kind of
  cheese did you use?"</p>

  <p>This was a bit sickening. However, by threatening to lay information
  against him, I have at last succeeded in inducing the occupier of
  140<font class="sc">b</font> to take over the abattoir at a very
  satisfactory valuation. It was between that and buying his mouse.</p>

<h2>A CONFLICT OF EMOTIONS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With the British Army in France.</i>)</p>

  <p>"I've seen rivetters at New York pie-foundries and stew-specialists on
  North Sea trawlers," said Percival severely, "but I never realised how
  monotonous feeding could be till I got into a Mess controlled by
  Binnie."</p>

  <p>Binnie puffed his pipe severely, being of the tough fibre which
  enables Mess Presidents to endure. Frederick, who had been silent, rose
  from his seat, heaved a distressing sigh and left the room.</p>

  <p>"There's the moral that adorns the tale, you&mdash;you public danger!"
  continued Percival, indicating Frederick's retreating figure. "Look to
  what a condition that once bright youth has been brought by your endless
  stews and curries."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," answered Binnie lightly. "Frederico could eat
  patent breakfast food and toasted doormats without taxing his digestion.
  His complaint is the tender passion. I recognise the symptoms."</p>

  <p>"It looks like an acute attack, anyhow," said Percival, rising, "and
  prompt counter-irritants are indicated. But I'll confirm your diagnosis
  first."</p>

  <p>Inside Frederick's quarters the sound of regular and sustained sighing
  suggested that the sufferer was in the throes of a spasm of melancholy.
  Percival entered and narrowly escaped being drawn into the vortex of a
  particularly powerful inspiration.</p>

  <p>"Freddy, old pard," he said kindly, "why so <i>triste</i>? If the
  trouble's financial, my cheque-book is unreservedly at your service.
  Havin' no balance at the bank I've no use for it myself."</p>

  <p>"It's not that&mdash;at least not worse than usual," groaned
  Frederick.</p>

  <p>"Then tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>"It's a long story," commenced Frederick.</p>

  <p>"Let me off with a synopsis," interrupted Percival.</p>

  <p>"Once upon a time," continued Frederick, "there was a big war, which
  made quite a stir in the daily papers and was a common subject of
  discussion in the clubs. There were many casualties, amongst them being a
  blithe young laddy who came down to the Base with a fractured maxilla
  caused by nibbling an M. and V. ration without previously removing the
  outside tin&mdash;or something of the sort. He was sent to hospital and
  devotedly tended by a Sister of exquisite beauty&mdash;such a figure and
  such hair! It wasn't exactly auburn and not exactly burnished
  bronze&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And it wasn't pale puce and it wasn't ultramarine," broke in Percival
  impatiently. "Tell me what it was, not what it wasn't."</p>

  <p>"I can't. It baffled description. Well, they drifted apart; but often
  afterwards, when that young laddy was studying his Manual of Military Law
  in his lonely dug-out, the image of Sister Carruthers glowed on the
  printed page. But I never met her again until the other day, when I was
  having a gentle toddle round Quelquepart and saw her gliding along the
  quay. Something gripped me by the heart; I took my courage in both hands
  and spoke to her.</p>

  <p>"'Don't you remember me, Sister?' I said. 'It was you who nursed me in
  No. 99 General.'</p>

  <p>"She looked at me coldly.</p>

  <p>"'As you are the third young officer who has adopted a similar method
  of introduction this afternoon,' she said, 'you must forgive me if I ask
  for some confirmation.'</p>

  <p>"'Surely you haven't forgotten?' I cried. 'You drew me a sweet little
  design in dots and dashes to hang over my bed. When I was evacuated to
  England I wanted to thank you, to ask if we might meet again, but you
  thrust a clinical thermometer between my teeth and told me not to speak
  till you gave me permission. Then you left me, and I was whisked away to
  the boat clinging grimly to the thermometer, inarticulate and
  heartbroken.'</p>

  <p>"'And I presume your object in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"
  id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span> speaking to me to-day is to return the
  thermometer?' she said primly.</p>

  <p>"That's where I took the full count," continued Frederick, sadly. "If
  I could have produced any old thing in the thermometer line my <i>bona
  fides</i> would have been established an' I could have gone ahead like
  cotton-mill shares. Instead of which, she'd said Good-day and gone while
  I was thinkin' out explanations. Since that time I've been parading
  Quelquepart simply bristling with thermometers, but I've never met her
  again."</p>

  <p>"The old Army fault of unpreparedness," remarked Percival. "You ought
  to go to hospital."</p>

  <p>"Don't be juvenile! What have hospitals to do with heartache?"</p>

  <p>"Everything, if you go to the right one&mdash;the one where your
  ministering angel ministrates, for instance."</p>

  <p>"Percival, old ace," said Frederick, with admiration, "you'll rank
  among the world's great thinkers yet. Turn on the current again and tell
  me what is my complaint."</p>

  <p>"Digestive trouble," said Percival promptly. "There's already been
  rumours about, and you'll be doing a public service by going to dock with
  dyspepsia. Binnie will be so stricken by remorse that he'll at once start
  providing the Mess with decent food."</p>

  <p>"Then for your sakes I'll rehearse the symptoms. But my curse will be
  on your head if I get to the wrong hospital."</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate that the M.O. was in an unsympathetic mood next
  morning. He thumped Frederick on the lower chest and pooh-poohed the idea
  of hospital. "All you want is a few of these tablets," he said, "and
  you'll be fit as nails in a day or two."</p>

  <p>Frederick crawled away dispiritedly to confide in Percival. That
  sapient youth counselled perseverance.</p>

  <p>"You must go right off your feed," he said. "Let the doc. see you
  feebly pecking and he'll soon get alarmed. In the meantime I'm off to
  give Binnie critical accounts of your appetite and send him to market
  right away."</p>

  <p>Only a burning passion and stealthy bars of chocolate could have
  sustained Frederick through the next few days. To sit down to breakfast
  with a healthy appetite and refuse his egg and rasher put the biggest
  possible strain on his constancy. His task was made doubly difficult by
  the scheming of Percival, who was constantly inciting Binnie to procure
  fresh delicacies.</p>

  <p>"You've crocked poor Freddy," he said; "and there will be others going
  the same way if you don't improve the messing. Now I saw some nice plump
  chickens to-day in the...."</p>

  <p>Thus harried, that evening Binnie provided a dinner that almost
  reduced Frederick to breaking-point. Only the fact that the M.O. was
  sitting opposite gave him strength to refuse the soup and fish, to trifle
  with the chicken and turn wearily from the sweet. As the savoury was
  being served he caught a scrap of conversation across the table.</p>

  <p>"... to the boat to see her off for demob.," the M.O. was saying to
  the Padre. "Jolly nice girl&mdash;Jim Carruthers' daughter, you
  know."</p>

  <p>Frederick pricked up his ears.</p>

  <p>"I remember," said the Padre. "She used to be at 99 General."</p>

  <p>There was no doubt who was the girl referred to. Frederick sat back in
  his chair with a heavy sense of disappointment and loss. He felt acutely
  sorry for himself. But presently above the pain in his heart there arose
  a stronger and more compelling feeling.</p>

  <p>"Corporal," he said, "I think after all I'll try one of those crab
  patties. Or you might tell the waiter to bring in <i>two</i>."</p>

    <h3>THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL.</h3>

<hr />

<h3>HOW TO ACT IN EMERGENCIES.</h3>

  <p><i>The Weekly Dispatch</i> symposium, in which various celebrities
  discuss the way to act in the event of a burglar being found in the
  house, shows the need for a little advice in case of emergencies. We
  append the following very helpful hints:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The old plan of offering a burglar a cigarette and asking him to take
  a chair while you telephone to the police is not now so successful as in
  the past. The best plan is to tackle the fellow right away. For this
  purpose you should step behind him, take hold of his coat and force it
  over his face. Then tie his left arm to his right leg across the back.
  Properly carried out, this method rarely fails.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>To attract the attention of the young lady behind a post-office
  counter, fire a revolver three times in succession, using blank
  cartridges. After first aid has been rendered to the attendants step up
  to the counter and purchase your stamp.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>If you should be knocked down by a taxi, don't be alarmed and try to
  creep out from under the thing. And don't blame the driver. Apologise to
  him, and, as you are being carried away, shake hands and tell him that
  while it was his cab it was your fault. Treated in this manner, drivers
  are not nearly so offensive when they knock you down the next time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Should the telephone-bell ring in your house, don't get excited. Keep
  calm. Remember General <font class="sc">Grant</font>. Remove the women
  and children to a place of safety, lift off the receiver and say, "Good
  Heavens! Whoever can it be?"</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Let us suppose that you are being attacked by a man with a chopper.
  Wait until the weapon is well poised over your head. Just as he begins
  the down stroke step aside smartly. The hatchet will then be found buried
  in the ground. This means that bygones are bygones.</p>

<h2>PETER AND JUDY.</h2>

  <p>Except for the fact that they had different sets of parents and were
  born some hundred miles apart, Peter and Judy are practically twins.
  Consequently, after an interval of three months, strenuous efforts were
  made by the two young mothers to bring about a proper introduction
  between the two wonders.</p>

  <p>The occasion was to be one of great importance, for it was Judy's very
  first tea-party, marking, as it were, the dawn of her social career. For
  days the post-office wrestled with the correspondence necessary to bring
  about the meeting. The mothers, both in person and by proxy, had scoured
  the precincts of Kensington and Oxford Street respectively for the
  necessary adornments to do their offspring justice, changing their minds
  so often that the assistants came to take as much interest in the party
  as if they were going to it themselves.</p>

  <p>And yet, when the great moment arrived and the strong silent man was
  borne into the room, round-eyed and expectant, he found his hostess
  already tired out with her first tea-party and fast asleep. He could
  scarcely believe his eyes; nor could Judy's scandalised father.</p>

  <p>Peter was very good about it. He bore this chilly reception stoically,
  deprecating any desire to wake the sleeping beauty&mdash;deprecating, in
  fact, any interest in her or her cot whatsoever. Ignoring the efforts of
  the Big People to fix his attention by pointing him directly at the main
  object of the tea-party (they should have known that babies like looking
  the <i>other</i> way always) he remained passively interested in a
  fascinating brass knob, the while getting his gloves into a satisfactory
  state of succulence before the Big People should take it on themselves to
  remove them.</p>

  <p>At last his patience is rewarded. The hostess, sighing sleepily, is
  beginning to show signs of realising her responsibilities. Two immense
  arms, two enormous fistfuls of fingers gather her up and she is borne
  through the air triumphantly.... Peter and Judy are introduced.</p>

  <p>I doubt whether any two people in this world ever displayed greater
  indifference. Solemnly they turn their eyes upon every other object in
  the room except each other. It is not until the number of permutations in
  which two people can look at everything is exhausted mathematically that
  their eyes meet at last.</p>

  <p>Then they cut each other dead.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Side by side they recline on the couch. Judy, pouting with sleep, is
  buffeting her face with her little white boxing-gloves, while Peter
  stares fascinated at the fire, quite sure that social functions are not
  in his line. "O-o!"</p>

  <p>With only three months' experience, Judy has not yet attained complete
  mastery of the art of manipulating difficult things like limbs.
  Inadvertently, and in excess of zeal to kick higher than any other baby,
  she has landed out a beautiful backhander and caught Peter hard in the
  tummy. Peter's eyes open wide. Creases appear on his face and widen. A
  cavern opens and a roar follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ya&mdash;o-o!"</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" (Judy looks up in amazement, for there is only one noise in
  the house like that, and she has the sole rights of it). "Hullo, is that
  me? I didn't know I was doing it"&mdash;(the roars from Peter
  continue)&mdash;"but I suppose I am. I must be. Let's have a lot more of
  this very good noise I am making&mdash;Ya&mdash;o-o!" <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span></p>

  <p>The duet produces a crescendo astounding to them both, for there has
  never been a noise so wonderful as this in all their experience. Then to
  Judy a very strange thing happens. She pauses for breath, but the noise
  goes on. "This is amazing&mdash;how do I do it?..."</p>

  <p>She joins in again&mdash;and then Peter stops. He too is puzzled
  vaguely. However, bother introspection, the concert proceeds, both
  artists doing their level best. Now one of them pauses, now the other,
  and at length serious doubts begin to creep in. There is something queer
  afoot&mdash;something....</p>

  <p>The matter resolves itself. Turning suddenly they behold each other,
  both yelling splendidly. Amazement! Cavern confronts cavern! Face to face
  they roar their hardest, demanding the reason for this strange
  phenomenon, "this other me who does when I don't."</p>

  <p>They pause&mdash;their mouths remain agape. Slowly they close and
  smiles succeed. Joy! A <i>reasonable</i>-sized face at last. What a
  relief after the enormous faces, the great mouths, the Cyranese noses of
  the Big People who are wont to come and peer. Here at last is a true
  face, a face that&mdash;no, they both agree not to dwell unduly on the
  discovery.</p>

  <p>Indifferent to each other once again they regard the special objects
  of their attention, their hands waving gently in the air, seeking the
  fairies that babies' hands are always trying to catch.</p>

  <p>Ha! their hands have met.</p>

  <p>"Hoo! It's a <i>reasonable</i> hand. It's got proper fingers, not
  stumps of bananas."</p>

  <p>"Moreover," says Peter politely, "if you care to take advantage of my
  offer you will find that it is properly moistened, succulent and suitable
  to a baby's taste. You needn't mind; I prepared it myself."</p>

  <p>"Goo! Gool-gur!" All is peace and chuckles. Hand-in-hand they survey
  their mothers. "<i>Our</i> mothers, yours&mdash;mine. Ha, ha&mdash;he,
  he&mdash;goo!"</p>

  <p>The inner thoughts of the two babies may be hidden from me (I accept
  the punishment), but I know&mdash;I <i>know</i> what the two mothers are
  thinking of. Twenty years hence, a paragraph in <i>The Times</i>:
  "Peter&mdash;Judy&mdash;" Oh, you fatuous mothers!</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"MR. TODD'S EXPERIMENT."</p>

  <p>A new terror&mdash;or else a new attraction&mdash;has been added to
  the British Drama. Mr. <font class="sc">Walter Hackett</font> has brought
  the scent of the cinema across the footlights. When he wants to inform
  you of certain episodes in the hero's past career, or let you know what
  he is doing when he is out of sight, he throws the main stage into
  darkness and lights up a smaller one on which he gives you as many as six
  little tabloid plays within the play.</p>

  <p>Such a scheme has its obvious conveniences for the playwright, and
  should greatly simplify the difficulties of stage-craft. Those
  introductory statements which are required to explain the opening
  conditions and need such adroit handling will no longer be necessary. You
  just put everybody wise by a series of <i>tableaux parlants</i>. No
  longer need the author worry about the best way of conveying to his
  audience the details of any action that takes place off the stage; he
  just turns on a playlet and there it is. Altogether, with a couple of the
  unities disposed of, he ought to have a much easier time.</p>

  <p>On the other hand he is going to have trouble with his principal stage
  and put his actors to the inconvenience of playing in a painfully
  congested area. Thus, in <i>Mr. Todd's Experiment</i>, the permanent
  scene was the hall of a house, with a large tapestry occupying more than
  half of the wall. Lurking behind this tapestry was the stage for the
  tabloids, and the general company had to crowd themselves into the
  remainder or wander forlornly about in the space in front of the
  tapestry. The playlets again are almost bound to be just concentrated
  episodes, probably elemental in theme and certainly elementary in
  treatment.</p>

  <p>The excuses for their interpolation in <i>Mr. Todd's Experiment</i>
  were not marked by a very great subtlety. There was really none for the
  first three, which simply relieved <i>Mr. Todd</i> of the tedious recital
  of the hero's disillusionments in love. The next two were introduced by
  way of illustrating his alleged gift of clairvoyance; and the last served
  frankly to fill in the interval while the rest of the company was away at
  dinner. The general effect of all these desultory little <i>Guignols</i>
  was perhaps rather cheap, and not very complimentary to the intelligence
  of those of us who had outgrown a childish <i>penchant</i> for
  peep-shows.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/110.png"><img width="100%" src="images/110.png"
      alt="" /></a>
    <p><i>Willoughby Todd</i> (<i>Mr. <font class="sc">Holman
    Clark</font></i>). "<font class="sc">Be your old true self. Make the
    women adore you.</font>"</p>

    <p><i>Arthur John Carrington</i> (<i>Mr. <font class="sc">Owen
    Nares</font></i>). "<font class="sc">Your advice is good. I will now
    take off my beard and be Owen Nares once more.</font>"</p>
  </div>
  <p><i>Mr. Todd's Experiment</i> (for I have spoken only of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Hackett's</font>) was to restore a <i>blasé</i> and
  valetudinarian young man of thirty to a proper state of energy by
  recalling the memories of his past loves and so reviving in him a desire
  to stand well in the eyes of the sex. For this purpose he produces (1) a
  bunch of wood-violets to suggest (through the nose) the environment of
  his first passion; (2) a specially-tipped brand of cigarettes to revive
  (through the mouth) the sentiment of his second; and a gramophone record
  to recover (through the ear) the associations of his third.</p>

  <p>So well does he succeed that the hero pulls himself together, shaves
  off his beard, becomes our <font class="sc">Owen Nares</font> again, and
  sallies forth, habited for conquest, to pay calls on all the three. From
  all the three he retires disillusioned, having found them as egoistic as
  himself, and in the end finds solace rather shamelessly, in the love of a
  devoted slave who might have been his for the taking any time in the last
  several years.</p>

  <p>The matter was pleasant enough, but its interest must, I think, have
  left us indifferent if it had not been for the diversion afforded by the
  playlets. While the idea was original, the presentation of it seemed to
  have a touch of amateurishness, though I would not go so far as to agree
  with the old fogey, played by Mr. <font class="sc">Fred Kerr</font>, who
  pronounced the scheme to be "all Tommy rot." With the exception of one
  character&mdash;the devoted slave&mdash;the lightness of the dialogue,
  mildly cynical, was due not so much to its wit as to the absence of
  ponderable stuff. The easy trick, so popular with the modern playwright,
  of letting the audience down in the middle of a serious situation was
  illustrated by the hero when, being in deadly earnest, he tells every
  woman in turn that she is the only woman he has ever loved.</p>

  <p>As <i>Mr. Todd</i>, Mr. <font class="sc">Holman Clark</font> was as
  fresh as he always is; but Mr. <font class="sc">Owen Nares</font> could
  hardly hope to satisfy the exigent demands of adoration in the part of
  young <i>Carrington</i>. Who, indeed, could sustain his reputation as a
  figure of romance when addressed as "Arthur-John"? Mr. <font
  class="sc">Fred Kerr</font>, who played <i>Martin Carrington</i>, the
  cantankerous uncle, cannot help being workmanlike; but he was asked to
  repeat himself too much. The best performance was that of Miss <font
  class="sc">Marion Lorne</font>, in the part of the hero's one devout
  lover, <i>Fancy Phipps</i>; her quiet sense of humour, salted with a
  slight American tang, kept the whole play together.</p>

<p class="author">O.S.</p>

<p class="center">"<font class="sc">Tea for Three.</font>"</p>

  <p>Playwright Mr. <font class="sc">Roi Cooper-Megrue</font>, and
  principal players Miss <font class="sc">Fay Compton</font>, the wife; Mr.
  <font class="sc">Stanley Logan</font>, the friend, and Mr. <font
  class="sc">A.E. Matthews</font>, the husband, made a first-rate thing of
  two-thirds of <i>Tea for Three</i>.</p>

  <p>The wife is without blemish physically or morally. The husband is
  faithful with a single-minded fidelity in thought, word and deed that
  looks (and, I am assured by equally innocent victims, is) positively
  deadly. The friend "frits and flutters" about in a distinctly casual, not
  to say polygamous, mood, but has one sacred place in his untidy heart in
  which the wife is enshrined. He can manage to sustain life so long as he
  may come to triangular tea on Thursdays. But the faithful husband puts
  his foot on that.</p>

  <p>Hence the stolen lunch for two with which the play opens. Philosophy
  there is, and very good philosophy too, from the flutterer and fritter,
  and such love-making as every virtuous woman (at heart a minx) allows.
  She is sorry, doubtless, for the suffering she causes, but (this is my
  gloss, not, I think, the author's) is really enjoying it like anything
  and taking jolly good care to look her best. Then follow little lies and
  as little and as needless and quite innocent indiscretions; and the
  jealous husband on the rampage.</p>

  <p>All this excellently put together, seasoned with wisdom and wit and
  most capably played; Miss <font class="sc">Fay Compton</font>, admirable
  example of a pretty actress who won't let herself be captured by stage
  tricks, making everything explicable except her continued love for her
  intolerable bore (and Turk) of a husband; Mr. <font class="sc">A.E.
  Matthews</font> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"
  id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> handling a desperately unsympathetic
  part, which was already beginning to look impossible, with great
  adroitness; and Mr. <font class="sc">Stanley Logan</font>, though badly
  hampered by a shocking cold and fighting a coughing audience, carrying
  the bulk of the good talk and lifting it gently over the few difficult
  places with a brilliant and well-concealed art.</p>

  <p>Thus till towards the end of the Second Act. Then a bad, a very bad,
  fairy stuffed into Mr. <font class="sc">Megrue's</font> head the idea of
  the suicide lottery. The infuriated husband, finding his wife in her
  friend's room at 7 <font class="sc">p.m.</font> (frightfully improper
  hour), sternly offers his bowler (or Derby) hat, in which are two cards.
  The one marked with a cross is drawn by the flutterer and means that he
  is for it. He is to kill himself within twenty-four hours.... And all
  this with perfect seriousness.</p>

  <p>You will see how the Third Act of a comedy which had tied itself in
  this kind of a knot simply could not be played. The author had completely
  sacrificed plausibility, and it was not uninteresting to see him twisting
  and turning, hedging and bluffing to save it; and a little uncomfortable
  to note the conviction oozing away out of the performers.... Queer also
  that it isn't more generally recognised that to come to the theatre with
  a loud persistent cough is a form of premeditated robbery with
  violence.</p>

<h3>A NEW LEAGUE OF NATIONS.</h3>

  <p>The latest development in connection with the International
  Brotherhood movement is the establishment of a College of Correct
  Cosmopolitan Pronunciation. The need of such an institution has long been
  clamant, and the visit of the Ukrainian choir has brought matters to a
  crisis. At their concert last week several strong women wept like men at
  their inability to pronounce the title of one of the most beautiful items
  on the programme&mdash;"Shtchedryk." Again, as Mr. <font
  class="sc">Smillie</font> must have bitterly reflected, how can we
  possibly render justice to the cause of Bolshevism so long as we are
  unable to pronounce the names of its leaders correctly? The same remark
  applies to the Russian Ballet; the Yugo-Slav handbell-ringers; the
  vegetarian Indian-club swingers from the Karakoram Himalayas; the
  polyphonic gong-players from North Borneo; the synthetic quarter-tone
  quartette from San Domingo; the anthropophagous back-chat comedians from
  the Solomon Islands; not to mention a host of other interesting
  companies, troupes, corroborees and pow-wows which are now in our midst
  for the purpose of cementing the confraternity of nations.</p>

<h2>REVOLT OF THE SUPER-GEORGIANS.</h2>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Wild Scenes at a Meeting of
Protest.</font></p>

  <p>An Indignation Meeting, to protest against the outrageous attacks
  levelled against Georgian writers and critics by Professor <font
  class="sc">Noyes</font> in his recent lecture at the Royal Institution
  and by Mr. A.D. <font class="sc">Godley</font> in an article in the
  current <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, was held last Saturday evening at the
  Klaxon Hall. The chair was taken by Mr. <font class="sc">Edward
  Marsh</font>, C.M.G., who was supported on the platform by a compact bevy
  of Georgian bards; but at an early stage of the meeting it became
  apparent that a majority of those present in the body of the hall were
  extremists of violent type, and eventually, as will be seen, the
  proceedings ended in something approximating to a free fight.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Marsh</font> began by a frank confession. He had
  taken a First Class in the Cambridge Classical Tripos. But the days in
  which he had been steeped to the lips in Latin and Greek were long past,
  never to return. For many years he had not composed hexameters, elegiacs
  or iambics. He had thrown in his lot with insurgent youth, not as a
  competitor or rival, but as an advocate, an admirer and an adviser.
  Indeed, if he might venture to say so, he sometimes acted as a brake on
  the wheels of the triumphal Chariot of Free Verse. He was not an adherent
  of the fantastic movement known as "Dada." He had no desire to abolish
  the family, morality, logic, memory, archæology, the law and the
  prophets. A little madness was a splendid thing, but it must be methodic.
  Still, for the rest he was a Georgian, heart and soul, and it pained him
  when men who ought to know better raised the standard of reaction and
  sought to discredit the achievements of his <i>protégés</i>. These
  attacks could not be passed over in silence, and the meeting had been
  convened to consider how they should be met, whether by a reasoned
  protest or by retaliation.</p>

  <p>Miss Messalina Stoot, who punctuated her remarks with the clashing of
  a pair of cymbals, observed that as a thorough-going Dadaist she had no
  sympathy with the half-hearted attitude of the Chairman. It was a battle
  between Dada and Gaga, and emphatically Dada must win.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mimram Stoot, who accompanied himself on the sarrusophone,
  endorsed the iconoclastic views of his sister. The only poetry that
  counted was that which caused spinal chills and issued from husky haughty
  lips. The moanings of mediæval molluscs were of no avail, though they
  might excite the crustacean fossils of Oxford, the home of lost
  causes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Seumas O'Gambhaoil wished to protest against Mr. <font
  class="sc">Noyes</font>' statement that there were ten thousand
  Bolshevist poets in our midst. This was a shameless underestimate of the
  total, which was at least twice that figure. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Godley's</font> offence, however, was much worse, as he was an
  Irishman, though of the self-expatriated type to which <font
  class="sc">Goldsmith</font> and <font class="sc">Moore</font> belonged.
  The rest of Mr. O'Gambhaoil's speech was delivered in Irish, but he was
  understood to advocate a repatriation of all Irish renegades to be tried
  and dealt with by the Sinn Fein Republic.</p>

  <p>Mr. Caradoc Cramp applauded the sentiments of the last speaker, but
  considered that he avoided the real issue. The Chairman had declared
  himself a Georgian, but that was not enough. The worst enemies of Free
  Verse were to be found in that camp. In technique and even in thought
  there was little to choose between many so-called Georgians and the most
  effete and reactionary Victorians. He alluded to the War poets, or rather
  the "Duration" poets, most of whom were already back-numbers. Between
  these and the Post-war poets, the true super-Georgians or
  paulo-post-Georgians, it was necessary to make a clean cut. To protest
  against Messrs. <font class="sc">Godley</font> and <font
  class="sc">Noyes</font> was a mere waste of time and energy. They might
  just as well protest against the existence of an extinct volcano or the
  skeleton of the brontosaurus. The real danger to be faced was the
  intrinsic subjectivity of the early and mid-Georgian poets, of whom the
  Chairman had been so powerful and consistent a supporter. He accordingly
  called for volunteers to storm the platform, and, a large number having
  responded to his appeal, Mr. <font class="sc">Marsh</font> was dislodged
  from the Chair after a gallant fight. A resolution of adherence to the
  principles of "Dada" having been passed by a large majority, the meeting
  broke up to the strains of the famous song&mdash;</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>Following the iconoclastic spirit of the age, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Barry Pain</font> has essayed in <i>The Death of Maurice</i>
  (<font class="sc">Skeffington</font>) the revolutionary experiment of a
  murder mystery tale that does not contain (<i>a</i>) a love interest,
  (<i>b</i>) a wrongly suspected hero, (<i>c</i>) a baffled inspector,
  (<i>d</i>) an amateur, but inspired, detective. It would be a grateful
  task to add that the result proves the superfluity of these time-worn
  accessories. But the cold fact is that, to me at least, the proof went
  the other way. From the first I was painfully aware of a lack of snap
  about the whole business, and I am more than suspicious that the author
  himself may have shared my unwilling indifference. <i>Maurice</i> was an
  artistic bachelor, a landowner, a manufacturer of jam, a twin (with a
  bogie gift of knowing at any moment the relative position of his other
  half, which might have been worked for far more effect than is actually
  obtained from it), and a reputation of making enemies. He had also an
  unusual neighbour, in the person of a young woman whose unconventionality
  led her to perambulate the common at midnight, playing the first bars of
  <i>Solveig's Song</i> upon the flute. One night, at the close of the
  first chapter, a gun was heard. But you are wrong to suppose (however
  naturally) that the flute-player was the victim. It was <i>Maurice</i>.
  And of course the problem was, who did it. I have told you my own
  experience of the working out; nothing written by Mr. <font
  class="sc">Barry Pain</font> can ever be really dull, just as no story
  starting with a mysterious murder can lack a certain intrigue; but the
  fact remains that my wish, heroically resisted, to look on to the last
  chapter was prompted more often by impatience than by any compelling
  curiosity. Others may be happier.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The author of <i>A Journal of Small Things</i> has done much to make
  us understand the sufferings of stricken France and the more intimate
  sorrows of war. <i>Chill Hours</i> (<font class="sc">Melrose</font>)
  deals with that dark period before the end, when, to some, it seemed all
  but certain that the will to victory must fail. Of the three parts of
  this gracious little book the first consists of six sketches of life
  behind the lines, life both gentle and simple, as affected by war.
  "Odette in Pink Taffeta," an episode of bereavement, is in particular
  exquisitely visualised. "Their Places" and "The Second Hay" treat, with a
  quiet intensity of conviction, of the absolutely deadening absorption, by
  overwork and anxiety, of peasant wives and children left to carry on in
  the absence of their men. The third part is a series of hospital
  vignettes. They do not attempt to be too cheery, but they have the stamp
  of realised truth. "Nostalgia," the second part, is in another
  mood&mdash;recalled memories of the beauties of a loved land and of dear
  common things affectionately seen. To those who dare look at war with
  open eyes and who take pleasure in sincere and beautifully-phrased
  writing I commend Mrs. <font class="sc">Helen Mackay's</font> book
  without reserve.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Somewhere in Christendom</i> (<font class="sc">Allen and
  Unwin</font>) is somewhat <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
  id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> embarrassing to a reviewer, for it has
  the theme of a great book with the manner of a trivial one. It is the
  history of a very much smaller nation, Ethuria, left despoiled and
  starving at the end of a nine-years' war, in which its great neighbours
  have used it as a battle-ground. Revolution begins, but a woman prophet
  steps in and switches it off in an unusual direction. The Ethurians
  perfect among themselves that fellowship which is the nice ideal behind
  many nasty manifestations in the real world, and, when next they are
  invaded by neighbouring nations anxious to use them as an excuse for
  belligerency, they resolutely stick to their guns (only the metaphor is
  most unsuitable), refuse to find any cause of quarrel with their "foreign
  brothers," and finally persuade them to abandon the ideals of war, so
  that peace on earth becomes a reality at last. Here is the book's theme;
  its working out allows for a boxing match between the President of Hygeia
  and the Foreign Secretary of Tritonia as the minimum of hostilities; a
  wicked newspaper lord, who pulls strings in both countries, and a
  faithful butler to the Royal Family, who becomes assistant state
  nursemaid and cleans silver as a hobby. Though I quite agree with Miss
  <font class="sc">Evelyn Sharp</font> and the Ethurians that it <i>is</i>
  love that makes the world go round, I am not so sure that either hers or
  theirs is the best way of advocating their common cause.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>You may remember an original and striking book of papers about the
  theatre under the title of <i>Buzz-Buzz</i>. Its author, <font
  class="sc">James E. Agate</font>, has now followed it with another,
  called, rather grimly, <i>Responsibility</i> (<font
  class="sc">Richards</font>). You will be absolutely correct in guessing
  that this is not a treatise on revue, being indeed an autobiographical
  novel of (I feel bound to add) precisely the same calibre as, in the
  sister realm of drama, made the name of Manchester at one period a word
  of awe. Why do these young Mancunians recollect to such stupendous
  purpose? Here is Mr. <font class="sc">Agate</font>, with an introduction
  of forty-four pages, all about time and infinity, before he can get his
  protagonist so much as started anywhere at all. It is a little like one
  of those demon-scenes out of the pantomimes he describes so
  lovingly&mdash;"<i>Do so! May safety and success attend on Crusoe.</i>"
  But of course the subsequent action is more responsible. I imagine Mr.
  <font class="sc">Agate's</font> picture of young-man life in the
  Manchester of the nineties to be very much like the real thing.
  Relaxation was not wholly remote from it. Cotton and commandments were
  broken with equal facility. Also you may be impressed by the number of
  Germans in it. Finally, after telling us, sometimes engagingly, sometimes
  verbosely, all he can remember about Lancashire, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Agate</font> brings his hero to Town, levers him along, year
  after year, and gets (almost on his last page) to his big situation. I
  won't spoil it. <i>Responsibility</i>, which might better have been
  called "Garrulity," is a novel containing boredom and charm in about
  equal proportions; not to mention promise for the days when its author
  has learned to discipline his too-ready pen.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>From the early part of 1915 until the end of 1917 Admiral Sir <font
  class="sc">Reginald Bacon</font> commanded at Dover, and from the preface
  to <i>The Dover Patrol</i> (<font class="sc">Hutchinson</font>) we can
  gather that he is smarting under a considerable sense of injustice and
  injury. Of the merits of his case&mdash;he frankly describes his
  dismissal as brutal&mdash;I do not pretend to judge, but can safely
  assume that the other side have something to say for themselves, if they
  care to. However, you are not to suppose that this is a bitter book. Most
  generous are the praises which the Admiral bestows upon his subordinates;
  his venom he reserves for just the chosen few who, no doubt, can bear it.
  Apart from personal recriminations, of which some of us must be more than
  tired, these two portly volumes are of real historical value. You will
  find in them not only a record of actual achievements, often carried out
  under desperately difficult conditions, but also of projects which for
  one reason or another were never fulfilled. "Why don't we try to land on
  the Belgian coast?" was a question our amateur strategists were never
  weary of asking. Well, here is their answer. Here, too, are countless
  photographs, charts, plans and diagrams&mdash;a really wonderful
  collection. Even if you are not in the least interested in Sir <font
  class="sc">Reginald's</font> grievances you will find him a writer who
  has a lot of useful things to say and knows how to say them.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
